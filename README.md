# Small Sumo Robots Single Sensor Line Detection Module

This repository contains the design and details of a compact, single-sensor line detection module optimized for mini/micro/nano sumo robots. It uses the QRE1113GR phototransistor sensor to provide precise line tracking in a very small form factor, ideal for space-constrained robotics applications.

## Overview

The Single Sensor Line Detection Module is designed for competitive robotics, offering a compact and reliable line sensing solution. With its small dimensions (7.874 mm x 7.239 mm), this module can easily be integrated into various mini, micro and nano sumo robots without sacrificing performance.

### Key Features
- **Sensor Type**: QRE1113GR phototransistor
- **Optimal Sensing Distance**: 3 mm
- **Output Format**: Analog only
- **Compact Size**: 7.874 mm x 7.239 mm
- **Connector**: Standard 3-pin interface (VCC, GND, SIG)

### Applications
This module is ideal for:
- Nano Sumo Robots
- Micro Sumo Robots
